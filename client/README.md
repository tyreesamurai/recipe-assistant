# TODOs

Need to manage creating a recipe:

- [ ] Make a button named "Create Recipe"
- [ ] After clicking the button, there should be a popover that has either create from URL or create manually
- [ ] If create from URL, there should be a text input to paste the URL & a button to fetch the recipe
- [ ] This form should be the same as the one for manual input, however the fields are pre-filled with the data fetched from the URL
- [ ] On submit, the recipe should be sent to the server to be saved, and the user should be redirected to the recipe page
